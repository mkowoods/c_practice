Practicing C for world domination!

Want to Implement the following algorithms(at least toy versions with interfaces)

- [x] Bubble sort, or in-place insertion sort (or any O(n^2) sort).
- [ ] Quick sort or merge sort (or any O((log n) * n) sort).
- [ ] Building and searching a balanced binary tree (or any tree construction and traversal methods).
- [x] Building and using a hash table.
- [ ] Finding an optimal hash for a static hash table.
- [ ] Approximate optimization (or search) by bifurcation (binary search).
- [ ] Dijkstra’s Algorithm (or any other graph search algorithms).
- [ ] LU decomposition (any method).
- [ ] Fisher-Yates Shuffle (and/or other set and permutation related algorithms).
- [ ] Minimum Spanning Trees (e.g. Prim’s Algorithm).
- [ ] standard xor neural network
- [ ] Boyer-Moore algorithm (from GNU grep)
